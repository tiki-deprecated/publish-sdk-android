### Installation

If you haven't already, add Maven Central to your Project's `build.gradle` (`PROJECT_ROOT/build.gradle`) 

``` 
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Add the dependency in your App's `build.gradle` file (`PROJECT_ROOT/app/build.gradle`)
```
implementation("com.mytiki:tiki-sdk-android:1.0.0")
```

### Usage

#### 1. [Sign up](https://console.mytiki.com) (free) for a TIKI developer account to get an API ID.

#### 2. Initialize the [TIKI SDK](tiki-sdk-android-tiki-sdk)

_Note: Must be called from the main UI thread_

Configuration parameters:

- **publishingId &#8594; String**   
  A unique identifier for your account. Create, revoke, and cycle Ids _(not a secret but try and treat it with care)_ at [console.mytiki.com](https://console.mytiki.com).


- **origin &#8594; String**  
  Included in the on-chain transaction to denote the application of origination (can be overridden in individual requests). It should follow a reversed FQDN syntax. _i.e. com.mycompany.myproduct_

  
- **context &#8594; [Context](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context)**   
  Set the application context. Required for the [MethodChannel](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/MethodChannel-class.html) which communicates with the [Dart SDK](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-dart) binaries


- **address &#8594; String? = null**  
  Set the user address. If not set, a new key pair and address will be generated for the user.


Example:

```
MainScope().launch { 
  val tiki = TikiSdk().init("565b3268-cdc0-4e5c-94c8-5d8f53d4577c", "com.mycompany.myproduct", applicationContext).await()
}
```

#### 3. Assign ownership
Data ownership can be assigned to any data point, pool, or stream, creating an immutable, on-chain record.

Parameters:
- **source &#8594; String**  
  An identifier in your system corresponding to the raw data. _i.e. a user_id_


- **type &#8594; [TikiSdkDataTypeEnum](tiki-sdk-android-tiki-sdk-data-type-enum)**  
  `"data_point"`, `"data_pool"`, or `"data_stream"`

  
- **contains &#8594; List&lt;String>**
  A list of metadata tags describing the represented data


- **origin &#8594; String? = null**  
  An optional override of the default origin set during initialization


- **about &#8594; String? = null**  
  An optional description to provide additional context to the transaction. Most typically as human-readable text.

Returns:

- **String**  
  The unique transaction id (use to recall the transaction record at any time)


Example:

```
MainScope().launch { 
  ...
  val oid = tiki.assignOwnership("12345", TikiSdkDataTypeEnum.data_point, listOf("email_address"))
}
```

#### 4. Modify consent
Consent is given (or revoked) for data ownership records. Consent defines "who" the data owner has given utilization rights.

Parameters:
- **ownershipId &#8594; String**  
  The transaction id for the ownership grant


- **destination &#8594; [TikiSdkDestination](tiki-sdk-android-tiki-sdk-destination)**  
  A collection of paths and application use cases that consent has been granted (or revoked) for.


- **about &#8594; String? = null**  
  An optional description to provide additional context to the transaction. Most typically as human-readable text.


- **reward &#8594; String? = null**  
  An optional definition of a reward promised to the user in exchange for consent.


- **expiry &#8594; Date? = null**  
  The date upon which the consent is no longer valid. If not set, consent is perpetual.

Returns:

- **[TikiSdkConsent](tiki-sdk-android-tiki-sdk-consent)**  
  the modified `TikiSdkConsent`

Example:
```
MainScope().launch { 
  ...
  val consent = tiki.modifyConsent(oid, TikiSdkDestination(listOf("*"), listOf("*")))
}
```

#### 5. Apply consent
Apply consent to a data transaction. If consent is granted for the `source` and `destination` and has not expired, the request is executed.

Parameters:
- **source &#8594; String**  
  An identifier in your system corresponding to the raw data.  
  _i.e. a user_id_


- **destination &#8594; [TikiSdkDestination](tiki-sdk-android-tiki-sdk-destination)**  
  The destination(s) and use case(s) for the request.


- **request &#8594; () &#8594; Unit**  
  The function to execute if consent granted


- **onBlocked &#8594; (value: String) &#8594; Unit? = null**  
  An optional function to execute if consent is denied.


- **origin &#8594; String? = null**  
  An optional override of the default origin set during initialization


Example:
```
MainScope().launch { 
  ...
  tiki.applyConsent("12345", TikiSdkDestination(listOf("*"), listOf("*")), { 
    print("Consent Approved. Send data to backend.")
  });
}
```
